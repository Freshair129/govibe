# Browser opens and you watch tests run in real-time
```

### Method 2: Debug Mode (Step-by-Step)
```bash
npm run e2e:debug
# Opens Playwright Inspector, step through each test
```

### Method 3: View HTML Report

## 📞 Support & Resources

### Official Documentation
- Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
- Testing Best Practices: https://playwright.dev/docs/testing

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Install all browsers
npx playwright install

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run with trace
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Show test trace
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Common Issues

**Tests timeout?**
- Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
- Check if selectors are correct
- Use headed mode to watch

**Selectors not found?**
- Verify HTML has the classes/IDs used in tests
- Use browser DevTools to inspect
- Run in headed mode to see

**Flaky tests?**
- Add explicit waits instead of fixed delays
- Use `waitForSelector` instead of timeouts
- Check for race conditions

---

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Test Writing
- Each test should test one behavior
- Use descriptive test names
- Avoid hard-coded waits (>500ms)
- Use `waitForSelector` for dynamic content

### Best Practices
- Run tests in parallel when possible
- Keep tests isolated (no shared state)
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown
- Review reports for flaky tests

### Performance
- Tests run in parallel by default
- Timeout after 30 seconds per test
- Retry failed tests automatically (on CI)

---

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Run tests before each commit
- [ ] Review test results weekly
- [ ] Update tests when landing page changes
- [ ] Add new tests for new features

### CI/CD Integration (Optional)
Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright
  run: npx playwright install

- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npm run e2e

- name: Upload report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

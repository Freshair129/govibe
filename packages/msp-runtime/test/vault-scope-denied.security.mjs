// WP-14 AC-04: every tool accepting a vault_id (directly, or via
// vault:{vault_id, vault_type}) returns vault_scope_denied (API-009 §5) when
// the caller's vault_id is not mounted/owned by them, verified against the
// real running process (not only in-process unit calls).
//
// Bounded-Scope investigation finding (recorded here, and in the final
// report): of packages/msp-runtime's actual delivered tool surface
// (WP-12/WP-13), msp_vault_mount is the ONLY tool whose request carries a
// real, caller-supplied vault_id. msp_context_resolve takes workspace_id/
// agent_id (no vault_id field at all -- verified directly against
// packages/govibe-core/src/msp-client.mjs's resolveContext() and
// transport/handlers/context-handlers.mjs's msp_context_resolve).
// msp_memory_promote takes agent_id and derives its Global-Private vault_id
// internally via domain/vault-registry.mjs's provisionGlobalPrivateVault --
// it never accepts a caller-supplied vault_id on the wire (verified against
// scripts/mcp/msp-vault-context-contracts.mjs's promoteMemory() and
// transport/handlers/lifecycle-handlers.mjs). WP-14's Explicit Exclusions
// forbid adding a new vault_id parameter to either tool's wire shape ("Any
// change to the msp_*/msp_memory_* wire request/response shapes beyond the
// new vault_scope_denied error path"), so this test file exercises
// msp_vault_mount, the one tool this enforcement genuinely applies to today.
//
// Per AC-07, this is an adversarial/boundary test and lives as
// *.security.mjs, run under node:test, mirroring
// test/canonical-candidate-rejection.security.mjs's convention.
